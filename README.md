# Jurassic
Jurassic is my Javascript game engine, which i wrote in 2017, when i was 15 years old. 
In 2019 i added obstacle detection class and tilemap settings for fun, but never used this engine for serious cases. 
It supportes JPEG and PNG import for game objects, mouse and keyboard events detection, 
animation tools, tilemap tools, intersection detection, dynamic camera events, borders detection for special objects, etc.
At that time i wrote up a tiny game called Square Life in order to test this engine. So, i made this file also being attached.
